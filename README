This project is a Dockerfile for running the Beam software stack to
operate Suitable Technology's now deprecated Beam robots.  The Linux
deb file depends on library versions found only in older versions of
Ubuntu, so I made a Dockerfile to run it in the appropriate
container. Audio and video recording and playback all work, and you
can use the Beam as expected.
